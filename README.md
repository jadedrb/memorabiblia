## Description

A glorified reading list. Whether they're books that you've already read or books that you intend on reading, list them here. Why? Well, you can take notes on them and be able to recall your favorite moments more easily. Search for specific books you've read in the past with ease and sort your list in a number of ways. The more information you input for each book, the more random facts your profile page will present to you. And who doesn't love random facts? 

## Tips

* Prepopulate (fetch) the book's information (like pages, genre, author) by inputting the title of the book then tapping the Book Cover image. 
* Seperate your interesting words with some kind of seperator, preferably a period. 
* Input as much information as you can about each book for a better Profile page experience
